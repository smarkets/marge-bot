# Marge-bot

Marge-bot is a merge-bot for GitLab that, beside other goodies,
implements
[the Not Rocket Science Rule Of Software Engineering:](http://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/1597.html)

> automatically maintain a repository of code that always passes all the tests.

— Graydon Hoare, main author of Rust

This simple rule of thumb is still nowadays surprisingly difficult to implement
with the state-of-the-art tools, and more so in a way that scales with team size
(also see our [blog
post](https://smarketshq.com/marge-bot-for-gitlab-keeps-master-always-green-6070e9d248df)).

Take, for instance, GitHub's well-known
[pull-request workflow](https://help.github.com/categories/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests).
Here, CI needs to pass on the branch before the pull request can be accepted but
after that, the branch is immediately merged (or rebased) into master. By the
time this happens, enough changes may have occurred to induce test breakage, but
this is only to be found out when the commits have already landed.

GitLab (in their [enterprise edition](https://about.gitlab.com/products/)),
offers an important improvement here with
their
[semi-linear history and fast-forward](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/) merge
request methods: in both cases a merge request can only be accepted if the
resulting master branch will be effectively the same as the merge request branch
on which CI has passed. If master has changed since the tests were last ran, it
is the *user's responsibility* to rebase the changes and retry. But this just
doesn't scale: if you have, a mono-repo, a large team working on short-lived
branches, a CI pipeline that takes 5-10 minutes to complete... then the number
of times one need's to rebase-and-try-to-accept starts to become unbearable.

Marge-bot offers the simplest of workflows: when a merge-request is ready, just
assign it to its user, and let her do all the rebase-wait-retry for you. If
anything goes wrong (merge conflicts, tests that fail, etc.) she'll leave a
message on the merge-request, so you'll get notified. Marge-bot can handle an
adversarial environment where some developers prefer to merge their own changes,
so the barrier for adoption is really low.

Whether marge-bot will or not wait for pipeline to succeed depends on the value of "✓
Pipelines must succeed" checkbox in your repo. It is available in all Gitlab
versions, so should not be a barrier.

Since she is at it, she can optionally provide some other goodies like tagging
of commits (e.g. `Reviewed-by: ...`) or preventing merges during certain hours.


## Configuring

Args that start with '--' (eg. --auth-token) can also be set in a config file
(specified via --config-file). The config file uses YAML syntax and must
represent a YAML 'mapping' (for details, see
http://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/yaml). If an arg is specified in more than one
place, then commandline values override environment variables which override
config file values which override defaults.

```bash
optional arguments:

                        you don't want this, even if you configured gitlab to use merge requests
                        to use merge commits on the *target* branch (the default).)
                           [env var: MARGE_USE_MERGE_STRATEGY] (default: False)

                        This is to handle the potential race condition where approvals don't reset in GitLab
                        after a force push due to slow processing of the event.

For more information about configuring marge-bot see `--help`


## Running

First, create a user for Marge-bot on your GitLab. We'll use `marge-bot` as
username here as well. GitLab sorts users by Name, so we recommend you pick one
that starts with a space, e.g. ` Marge Bot`, so it is quicker to assign to (our
code strips trailing whitespace in the name, so it won't show up elsewhere).
Then add `marge-bot` to your projects as `Developer` or `Maintainer`, the latter
being required if she will merge to protected branches.

For certain features, namely, `--impersonate-approvers`, and `--add-reviewers`,
you will need to grant `marge-bot` admin privileges as well. In the latter, so
that she can query the email of the reviewers to include it in the commit. Note
that if you're trying to run marge-bot against a GitLab instance you don't have
yourself admin access to (e.g. https://www.gitlab.com), you won't be able to use
features that require admin for marge-bot.

Second, you need an authentication token for the `marge-bot` user. You will need
to select the `api` and `read_user` scopes in all cases.

If marge-bot was made an admin to handle approver impersonation and/or adding a
reviewed-by field, then you will also need to add **`sudo`** scope under
`Impersonation Tokens` in the User Settings. Assuming your GitLab install is
install is `https://your-gitlab.example.com` the link will be at
`https://your-gitlab.example.com/admin/users/marge-bot/impersonation_tokens`).

On older GitLab installs, to be able to use impersonation features if marge-bot
was made an admin, use the **PRIVATE TOKEN** found in marge-bot's `Profile
Settings`; otherwise just use a personal token (you will need to impersonate the
marge-bot user via the admin UI to get the private token, it should then be at
`http://my-gitlab.example.com/profile/personal_access_tokens` reachable via
`Profile Settings -> Acess Tokens`).

Once you have the token, put it in a file, e.g. `marge-bot.token`.

Finally, create a new ssh key-pair, e.g like so

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C marge-bot@invalid -f marge-bot-ssh-key -P ''
```

Add the public key (`marge-bot-ssh-key.pub`) to the user's `SSH Keys` in GitLab
and keep the private one handy.

### Running marge-bot in docker (what we do)

Assuming you have already got docker installed, the quickest and most minimal
way to run marge is like so (*but see note about passing secrets on the
commandline below*):

```bash
docker run --restart=on-failure \ # restart if marge crashes because GitLab is flaky
  -e MARGE_AUTH_TOKEN="$(cat marge-bot.token)" \
  -e MARGE_SSH_KEY="$(cat marge-bot-ssh-key)" \
  smarkets/marge-bot \
  --gitlab-url='http://your.gitlab.instance.com'
```

Note that other users on the machine can see the secrets in `ps`, because
although they are env vars *inside* docker, we used a commandline switch to set
them for docker run.

To avoid that you have several options. You can just use a yaml file and mount
that into the container, for example this is how we actually run marge-bot at
Smarkets ourselves:

```yaml
# marge-bot-config.yml
add-part-of: true
add-reviewers: true
add-tested: true
impersonate-approvers: true
gitlab-url: "https://git.corp.smarkets.com"
project-regexp: "smarkets/smarkets$"
auth-token: "WoNtTelly0u"
ssh-key: |
    -----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
    [...]
    -----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
```

```bash
docker run --restart=on-failure \
  -v "$(pwd)":/configuration \
  smarkets/marge-bot \
  --config-file=/configuration/marge-bot-config.yaml
```

By default docker will use the `latest` tag, which corresponds to the latest
stable version. You can also use the `stable` tag to make this more explicit.
If you want a development version, you can use the `master` tag to obtain an
image built from the HEAD commit of the `master` branch. Note that this image
may contain bugs.

You can also specify a particular version as a tag, e.g.
`smarkets/marge-bot:0.7.0`.

### Running marge-bot in kubernetes
It's also possible to run marge in kubernetes, e.g. here's how you use a ktmpl
template:

```bash
ktmpl ./deploy.yml \
--parameter APP_NAME "marge-bot" \
--parameter APP_IMAGE "smarkets/marge-bot" \
--parameter KUBE_NAMESPACE "marge-bot" \
--parameter MARGE_GITLAB_URL 'http://your.gitlab.instance.com' \
--parameter MARGE_AUTH_TOKEN "$(cat marge-bot.token)" \
--parameter MARGE_SSH_KEY "$(cat marge-bot-ssh-key)" \
--parameter REPLICA_COUNT 1 | kubectl -n=${KUBE_NAMESPACE} apply --force -f -
```

Once running, the bot will continuously monitor all projects that have its user as a member and
will pick up any changes in membership at runtime.

### Running marge-bot in Swarm
Or you can run marge in Docker Swarm, e.g. here's how you use a compose file:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  marge-bot:
    image: smarkets/marge-bot:latest
    configs:
      - source: marge_bot_config
        target: /configuration/marge-bot-config.yaml
    command:
      - "--config-file=/configuration/marge-bot-config.yaml"
    deploy:
      mode: replicated
      replicas: 1
      restart_policy:
        condition: on-failure
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 256M

configs:
  marge_bot_config:
    file: ./marge-bot-config.yaml
    name: marge_bot_config
```

### Running marge-bot in CI

You can also run marge-bot directly in your existing CI via scheduled pipelines
if you'd like to avoid setting up any additional infrastructure.

This way, you can inject secrets for marge-bot's credentials at runtime
inside the ephemeral container for each run by adding them to protected CI/CD
variables in a dedicated marge-bot runner project, as well as store execution
logs as artifacts for evidence.

You can also configure multiple setups in different CI schedules by supplying
`MARGE_*` environment variables per-schedule, such as running a different set
of projects or settings at different times.

Note that in this case, marge-bot will be slower than when run as a service,
depending on the frequency of your pipeline schedules.

Create a marge-bot runner project, and add the variables `MARGE_AUTH_TOKEN`
(of type Variable) and `MARGE_SSH_KEY_FILE` (of type File) in your CI/CD
Variables settings.

Then add a scheduled pipeline run to your project with the following minimal
`.gitlab-ci.yml` config:

```yaml
run:
  image:
    name: smarkets/marge-bot:latest
    entrypoint: [""]
  only:
    - schedules
  variables:
    MARGE_CLI: "true"
    MARGE_GITLAB_URL: "$CI_SERVER_URL"
  script: marge.app
```

### Running marge-bot as a plain python app

#### Installing marge-bot with nix

Alternatively, if you prefer not to use docker, you can also directly run marge.
If you use [nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) do `nix-env --install -f default.nix`.

The nix install should be fully reproducible on any version of linux (and also
work on OS X, although this is not something we properly test). If you don't
want to use docker we recommend you give nix a try.

#### Installing marge-bot the old-fashioned way

Finally, although this is our least preferred alternative, you can always do
`python3 setup.py install` (note that you will need python3.6).

Afterwards, the minimal way to run marge is as follows.

```bash
marge.app --auth-token-file marge-bot.token \
          --gitlab-url 'http://your.gitlab.instance.com' \
          --ssh-key-file marge-bot-ssh-key
```

However, we suggest you use a systemd unit file or some other mechanism to
automatically restart marge-bot in case of intermittent GitLab problems.

## Suggested workflow
1. Alice creates a new merge request and assigns Bob and Charlie as reviewers

2. Both review the code and after all issues they raise are resolved by Alice,
   they approve the merge request and assign it to `marge-bot` for merging.

3. Marge-bot rebases the latest target branch (typically master) into the
   merge-request branch and pushes it. Once the tests have passed and there is a
   sufficient number of approvals (if a minimal approvals limit has been set on
   the project), Marge-bot will merge (or rebase, depending on project settings)
   the merge request via the GitLab API. It can also add some headers to all
   commits in the merge request as described in the next section.


## Adding Reviewed-by:, Tested: and Part-of: to commit messages

Marge-bot supports automated addition of the following
two [standardized git commit trailers](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.11/process/submitting-patches.html#using-reported-by-tested-by-reviewed-by-suggested-by-and-fixes):
`Reviewed-by` and `Tested-by`. For the latter it uses `Marge Bot
<$MERGE_REQUEST_URL>` as a slight abuse of the convention (here `Marge Bot` is
the name of the `marge-bot` user in GitLab).

If you pass `--add-reviewers` and the list of approvers is non-empty and you
have enough approvers to meet the required approver count, Marge will add the
following header to each commit message and each reviewer as it rebases the
target branch into your PR branch:

```
Reviewed-by: A. Reviewer <a.reviewer@example.com>
```

All existing `Reviewed-by:` trailers on commits in the branch will be stripped. This
feature requires marge to run with admin privileges due to a peculiarity of the
GitLab API: only admin users can obtain email addresses of other users, even
ones explicitly declared as public (strangely this limitation is particular to
email, Skype handles etc. are visible to everyone).

If you pass `--add-tested` the final commit message in a PR will be tagged with
`Tested-by: marge-bot <$MERGE_REQUEST_URL>` trailer. This can be very useful for
two reasons:

1. Seeing where stuff "came from" in a rebase-based workflow
2. Knowing that a commit has been tested, which is e.g. important for bisection
   so you can easily and automatically `git bisect --skip` untested commits.

Additionally, by using `--add-part-of`, all commit messages will be tagged with
a `Part-of: <$MERGE_REQUEST_URL>` trailer to the merge request on which they
were merged. This is useful, for example, to go from a commit shown in `git
blame` to the merge request on which it was introduced or to easily revert a all
commits introduced by a single Merge Request when using a fast-forward/rebase
based merge workflow.

## Impersonating approvers
If you want a full audit trail, you will configure GitLab
[require approvals](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/merge_request_approvals.html#approvals-required)
for PRs and also turn on
[reset approvals on push](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/merge_request_approvals.html#reset-approvals-on-push).
Unfortunately, since Marge-bot's flow is based on pushing to the source branch, this
means it will reset the approval status if the latter option is enabled.
However, if you have given Marge-bot admin privileges and turned on
`--impersonate-approvers`, she will re-approve the merge request assuming after its own
push, but by impersonating the existing approvers.

## Merge embargoes

Marge-bot can be configured not to merge during certain periods. E.g., to prevent
her from merging during weekends, add `--embargo 'Friday 6pm - Monday 9am'`.
This is useful for example if you automatically deploy from master and want to
prevent shipping late on a Friday, but still want to allow marking merge requests as
"to be merged on Monday": just assign them to `marge-bot` as any other day.

More than one embargo period can be specified, separated by commas. Any merge
request assigned to her during an embargo period, will be merged in only once all
embargoes are over.


## Batching Merge Requests

The flag --batch enables testing and merging merge requests in batches. This can
significantly speed up the rate at which marge-bot processes jobs - not just
because merge requests can be tested together, but because marge-bot will ensure
the whole set of merge requests is mergeable first. This includes, for example,
checking if a merge request is marked as WIP, or does not have enough approvals.
Essentially, users get faster feedback if there is an issue. Note that you
probably won't need this unless you have tens of merge requests a day (or
extremely slow CI).

### How it works

If marge-bot finds multiple merge requests to deal with, she attempts to create
a batch job. She filters the merge requests such that they have all have a
common target branch, and eliminates those that have not yet passed CI (a
heuristic to help guarantee the batch will pass CI later).

Once the merge requests have been gathered, a batch branch is created using the
commits from each merge request in sequence. Any merge request that cannot be
merged to this branch (e.g. due to a rebase conflict) is filtered out. A new
merge request is then created for this branch, and tested in CI.

If CI passes, the original merge requests will be merged one by one.

If the batch job fails for any reason, we fall back to merging the first merge
request, before attempting a new batch job.

### Limitations

* Currently we still add the tested-by trailer for each merge request's final
  commit in the batch, but it would probably be more correct to add the trailer
  only to the last commit in the whole batch request (since that's the only one
  we know passed for sure in that combination). We might change this in the
  future or make it configurable, but note that there's still a much stronger
  chance all intermittent final commits also passed then when just testing on
  each source branch, because we know the final linearization of all commits
  passes in that all MRs passed individually on their branches.

* As trailers are added to the original merge requests only, their branches
  would need to be pushed to in order to reflect this change. This would trigger
  CI in each of the branches again that would have to be passed before merging,
  which effectively defeats the point of batching. To workaround this, the
  current implementation merges to the target branch through git, instead of the
  GitLab API. GitLab will detect the merge request as having been merged, and
  update the merge request status accordingly, regardless of whether it has
  passed CI. This does still mean the triggered CI jobs will be running even
  though the merge requests are merged. marge-bot will attempt to cancel these
  pipelines, although this doesn't work too effectively if external CI is used.

* There is what can be considered to be a flaw in this implementation that could
  potentially result in a non-green master; consider the following situation:

  1. A batch merge request is created, and passes CI.
  2. Several merge requests are then merged to master, but one could fail
     (perhaps due to someone pushing directly to master in between).
  3. At this point, marge-bot will abort the batch job, resulting in a subset of
     the batch merge requests having been merged.

  We've guaranteed that individually, each of these merge requests pass CI, and
  together with some extra merge requests they also pass CI, but this does not
  guarantee that the subset will. However, this would only happen in a rather
  convoluted situation that can be considered to be very rare.

## Restricting the list of projects marge-bot considers

By default marge-bot will work on all projects that she is a member of.
Sometimes it is useful to restrict a specific instance of marge-bot to a subset
of projects. You can specify a regexp that projects must match (anchored at the
start of the string) with `--project-regexp`.

One use-case is if you want to use different configurations (e.g.
`--add-reviewers` on one project, but not the others). A simple way of doing is
run two instances of marge-bot passing `--add-reviewers --project-regexp
project/with_reviewers` to the first instance and `--project-regexp
(?!project/with_reviewers)` to the second ones. The latter regexp is a negative
look-ahead and will match any string not starting with `project/with_reviewers`.

## Restricting the list of branches marge-bot considers

It is also possible to restrict the branches marge-bot watches for incoming
merge requests. By default, marge-bot will process MRs targeted for any branch.
You may specify a regexp that target branches must match with `--branch-regexp`.

This could be useful, if for instance, you wanted to set a regular freeze
interval on your master branches for releases. You could have one instance of
marge-bot with `--embargo "Friday 1pm - Monday 9am" --branch-regexp master` and
the other with `--branch-regexp (?!master)`. This would allow development to
continue on other branches during the embargo on master.

It is possible to restrict the source branches with `--source-branch-regexp`.

## Some handy git aliases

Only `git bisect run` on commits that have passed CI (requires running marge-bot with `--add-tested`):
```
git config --global alias.bisect-run-tested \
 'f() { git bisect run /bin/sh -c "if !(git log -1 --format %B | fgrep -q \"Tested-by: Marge Bot\"); then exit 125; else "$@"; fi"; }; f'
```
E.g. `git bisect-run-tested ./test-for-some-bug.sh`.

Revert a whole MR, in a rebase based workflow (requires running marge-bot with `--add-part-of`):
```
git config --global alias.mr-revs '!f() { git log --grep "^Part-of.*/""$1"">" --pretty="%H"; }; f'
git config --global alias.mr-url '!f() { git log -1 --grep "^Part-of.*/""$1"">" --pretty="%b" | grep "^Part-of.*/""$1"">"  | sed "s/.*<\\(.*\\)>/\\1/"; }; f'
git config --global alias.revert-mr '!f() { REVS=$(git mr-revs "$1"); URL="$(git mr-url "$1")";  git revert --no-commit $REVS;  git commit -m "Revert <$URL>$(echo;echo; echo "$REVS" | xargs -I% echo "This reverts commit %.")"; }; f'
```

E.g. `git revert-mr 123`. This will create a single commit reverting all commits
that are part of MR 123 with a commit message that looks like this:

```
Revert <http://gitlab.example.com/mygropup/myproject/merge_requests/123>

This reverts commit 86a3d35d9bc12e735efbf72f3e2fb895c0158713.
This reverts commit e862330a6df463e36137664f316c18b5836a4df7.
This reverts commit 0af5b70a98858c9509c895da2a673ebdb31e20b1.
```

E.g. `git revert-mr 123`.


## Troubleshooting

Marge-bot continuously logs what she is doing, so this is a good place to look
in case of issues. In addition, by passing the `--debug` flag, additional info
such as REST requests and responses will be logged. When opening an issue,
please include a relevant section of the log, ideally ran with `--debug` enabled.

The most common source of issues is the presence of git-hooks that reject
Marge-bot as a committer. These may have been explicitly installed by someone in
your organization or they may come from the project configuration. E.g., if you
are using `Settings -> Repository -> Commit author's email`, you may need to
whitelist `marge-bot`'s email.

Some versions of GitLab are not good at reporting merge failures due to hooks
(the REST API may even claim the merge operation succeeded), you can find
this in `gitlab-rails/githost.log`, under GitLab's logs directory.
